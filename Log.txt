# Log (This file will details logs, events, issues or todos that you encounter that you want to record to reference or remind you of later on.)


-TODO: Open Dev Tools menu to form record of sole dev.tool record.

-TODO: Cannot get quick_upgradable_module_ids (dev.tool m2m) to update when show_in_devtools (ir.module.module bool) is toggled off.

-TODO: Couldn't call button_uninstall_wizard method from js. Calling custom .py method as an alternative.

-TODO: Enable humor functionality to display on successfull module upgrade.

-May have to refactor how the module alert status indicator (the one that pulses in the system tray) functions. Depdending on what is refactored, may have to rename the upgrade_success_alert_style field.
 as currently, it is used mostly only used to alert the user of a successfull upgrade. 

-TODO: For inputshell, may likely need to create a new model for defining shell modes (i.e. shell.mode or something).

-TODO: Add more customization options for glass sticky tool (sticky color, transparency range, toggleable passthrough, if I can get it to work).

-TODO: Considering allowing utilization of multiple stickies. If so, may need to create a new model for stickies and link from dev.tool as o2m

-TODO: The t-if condition used in dis/enabling the input tray and glass sticky tools dont seem to be working. I believe this is because I am extended the
       webclient to add those tools with a patched webclient for both tools. Somehow, as a result, the condition check fails. I suspect it is because the 
       variables/properties (which I defined in the patches) used in the condition do not exist when my extended webclient view component is rendered.
       Will need to find a solution for this.  

-In addition to having hotkeys for tools, you can have icons in the system tray that trigger various tools
