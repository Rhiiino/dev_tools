# Tool ideas
Dropdown multi-mode shell

System tray module dropdown
-Allow in/uninstall functionality through module status icon
-Allow upgrade functionility through a second icon or simply by clicking on module name

-Display sticky to inform user of in/uninstall or restarts
-Maybe enable colored flash on system tray to signify module interaction status (ex: failed upgrades)
-Provide options for upgrade success alert (fleeting sticky note, subtle icon in systray, none). If sticky is choosen, allow toggle for humor (if set, add a funny message to bottom of sticky)
