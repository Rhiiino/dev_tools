# Tool Stuf

------ Refs ------
https://github.com/odoo/owl/blob/master/doc/readme.md

---------- Ideas ----------
-Draggable/Sticky sticky notes
-Server action triggered by hotkey (Standalone/seperate from input shell's ORM mode)
-Transparant sticky overlayed on the webclient/views, allowing you to visualize what you are taking notes on.




----------Module Tray ----------
-Allow in/uninstall functionality through module status icon
-Allow upgrade functionility through a second icon or simply by clicking on module name
-Display sticky to inform user of in/uninstall or restarts
-Maybe enable colored flash on system tray to signify module interaction status (ex: failed upgrades)
-Provide options for upgrade success alert (fleeting sticky note, subtle icon in systray, none). If sticky is choosen, allow toggle for humor (if set, add a funny message to bottom of sticky)


---------- Input Shell ----------
-Possibly alow a mode where you can jot down and store quick notes.
